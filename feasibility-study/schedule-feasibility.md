## ðŸ”¹ Phase-Wise Explanation

### Phase 1 â€“ Planning & Feasibility (July 1 â€“ July 14)
- Conduct detailed feasibility studies (technical, economic, operational, legal, schedule).
- Gather requirements from stakeholders (students, professors, NGO partners).
- Create diagrams (use case, flowcharts) to visualize processes.  
**Deliverable:** SRS document finalized and approved.

### Phase 2 â€“ Design (July 15 â€“ Aug 4)
- Develop high-level system architecture (component & deployment).
- Create detailed low-level designs (class, sequence, activity diagrams).  
**Deliverable:** Software Design Document (SDD).

### Phase 3 â€“ Development (Aug 5 â€“ Sept 8)
- Build AI Care Companion Service (using Gemini AI + RAG for safe responses).
- Set up backend: Node.js APIs, PostgreSQL database, Firebase for real-time updates.
- Develop frontend: Flutter mobile app (Android + iOS), React dashboard for doctors/NGOs.  
**Deliverable:** MVP prototype (basic but functional).

### Phase 4 â€“ Testing & Integration (Sept 9 â€“ Sept 22)
- Conduct unit testing for AI, backend, and frontend modules.
- Perform system testing to check module integration.
- Fix major bugs and ensure basic data security (encryption & secure storage).  
**Deliverable:** Stable, integrated system ready for demo.

### Phase 5 â€“ Finalization (Sept 23 â€“ Sept 30)
- Refine user interface (UI/UX polishing).
- Finalize project documentation.
- Conduct internal demo rehearsals.  
**Deliverable:** Final academic report + working demo.

### Submission & Presentation (Oct 1 â€“ Oct 5)
- Submit project report, code, and documentation.
- Deliver live prototype demo to faculty/academic panel.  
**Deliverable:** Final submission + evaluation presentation.

## ðŸ”¹ Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk                  | Impact                           | Mitigation Strategy                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Tight Timeline        | May cause incomplete features    | Focus on core MVP first; secondary features only if time permits |
| AI Complexity (Gemini Integration) | Could delay backend           | Use fallback: a simplified chatbot-based model         |
| Testing Overlap       | Errors discovered late           | Start testing in parallel with development            |
| Resource Constraints  | Limited access to APIs or servers| Use free-tier APIs, cloud services, and local testing |
| Dependency Delays     | Academic approvals/reviews may lag| Schedule buffer reviews at end of each phase          |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

The **Clinico project** is **schedule feasible** within the academic semester (Julyâ€“October 2025), provided the development team adheres to the defined phase structure. By:

- Prioritizing the AI Care Companion MVP,  
- Ensuring strict milestone tracking, and  
- Allocating sufficient time for testing & documentation,  

the project will be ready for **submission and demonstration by the first week of October 2025**.
