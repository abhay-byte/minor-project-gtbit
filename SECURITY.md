## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities you might find.

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report any security issues directly to the project lead via email:

**Email:** `abhay.raj.dev@email.com` (Replace with your actual contact email)

When reporting a vulnerability, please include a detailed description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, and the potential impact.

You can expect to receive an initial acknowledgement from our team within **48-72 hours**. We will then work to validate the vulnerability and will keep you updated on our progress toward a fix and potential public disclosure. We thank you in advance for your contribution to keeping Clinico secure.
