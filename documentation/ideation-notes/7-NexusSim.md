#### **Problem Statement**

Training professionals for high-stakes, complex jobs‚Äîsuch as surgeons, airline pilots, or power grid technicians‚Äîis incredibly expensive, dangerous, and logistically challenging. Physical simulators are monolithic and inaccessible, while real-world training can involve unacceptable risks to life and billion-dollar equipment. This creates a critical gap between theoretical knowledge and the ability to perform complex, collaborative procedures under intense pressure.

#### **Solution**

NexusSim is a collaborative, cloud-based **Metaverse** platform providing photorealistic **Digital Twins** of complex industrial and medical environments. Trainees can meet as avatars to practice critical, hands-on procedures together under the guidance of a human instructor and a sophisticated **AI Proctor**. This AI can simulate a near-infinite number of "un-trainable" emergency scenarios that are impossible to replicate in real life. A connected **AR** application provides on-the-job procedural guidance, bridging the gap from training to real-world execution.
