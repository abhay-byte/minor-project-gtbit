#### **Problem Statement**

The discovery of new medicines is a slow, astronomically expensive, and often siloed process. Scientists study complex 3D structures like proteins and viruses on 2D screens, making it incredibly difficult to intuitively understand their shape and how a drug molecule might interact with them. This process involves constant context-switching between digital modeling and physical lab work, introducing significant delays and inefficiencies between a virtual hypothesis and its real-world test.

#### **Solution**

BioScaffold+ is a secure, persistent **Metaverse** platform that transforms complex proteomic data into tangible, interactive 3D models in a shared virtual laboratory. Scientists can meet as avatars to intuitively manipulate molecular structures. The platform is enhanced by a "Lab-in-the-Loop" **IoT** ecosystem: an integrated **AI** can take a virtual experiment designed in the metaverse and automatically execute it on physical, IoT-enabled lab robots. The results are then streamed directly back into the metaverse, closing the loop and accelerating the research cycle from weeks to hours.
