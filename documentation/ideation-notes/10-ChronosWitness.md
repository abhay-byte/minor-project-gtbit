#### **Problem Statement**

The integrity of the justice system relies on a jury's or judge's ability to accurately understand the spatial and temporal relationships of a critical incident. This understanding is currently built from a fragmented collection of 2D photos, witness testimony, and complex diagrams, which is highly susceptible to cognitive bias and spatial misinterpretation. More critically, witness testimony can be unreliable, and establishing a verifiable, second-by-second timeline of events is a painstaking manual process.

#### **Solution**

Chronos Witness+ is a forensically-sound platform that creates objective, 1:1 scale **Digital Twins** of crime scenes and other critical incidents. Built from immutable data sources like LiDAR scans, it allows jurors to explore the scene in **VR** from any perspective. The platform's core innovation is its **IoT Corroborator**: it ingests and synchronizes time-stamped data from all available IoT devices (e.g., security sensors, smart locks, vehicle telematics). An **AI Analyst** then cross-references human testimony against this incorruptible digital witness layer, highlighting objective facts and flagging inconsistencies for the court.

#### **‚ú® Feature List**

*   **üèõÔ∏è The Forensic Digital Twin:**
    *   **Immutable Scene Reconstruction:** Creates scientifically accurate, explorable 1:1 digital replicas of scenes from court-admitted scan data.
    *   **Multi-Perspective Walkthrough:** Allows jurors to understand scales, distances, and spatial relationships firsthand, and to instantly jump to the exact viewpoint of any witness.
    *   **Evidence Hotspots:** Key pieces of evidence in the virtual scene are interactive, linking directly to the corresponding forensic reports and photos.
*   **ü§ñ The AI Forensic Analyst:**
    *   **Testimony-to-Data Correlation:** The AI automatically cross-references claims made in testimony (e.g., "I heard a sound at 10:02 PM") against the IoT event timeline.
    *   **Line-of-Sight & Possibility Validation:** The AI can instantly and definitively calculate if a witness's claimed viewpoint was physically possible or obstructed.
    *   **Objective Inconsistency Flagging:** The system highlights contradictions between testimony and the immutable IoT data for legal review, without passing judgment.
