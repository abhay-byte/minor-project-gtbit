#### **Problem Statement**

Neuroscience has made incredible strides in reading neural data (Brain-Computer Interfaces - BCI) and writing neural data (via stimulation). However, these remain two separate domains. We have never "closed the loop" to achieve a direct, high-bandwidth transmission of a complex neural concept from one brain to another. We do not know what the fundamental "neural code" for a concept like "apple" or a motor command like "grasp" looks like, or if it's even translatable between individuals.

#### **Solution**

The Cortical Bridge is a foundational research platform to attempt the first-ever **AI-mediated**, concept-level brain-to-brain communication. It involves two participants, each fitted with a next-generation, high-density **BCI**. An advanced **AI model** acts as a universal "neural translator." The AI learns to recognize the neural patterns in "Brain A" corresponding to a specific concept. It then translates this pattern into a new, optimized pattern of non-invasive micro-stimulation that can evoke the same, or a similar, concept in "Brain B," seeking to create a shared perceptual experience.
