#### **Problem Statement**

Modern agriculture is at a tipping point, facing a dual crisis of inefficiency and environmental unsustainability. The prevailing method of blanket-applying water, pesticides, and fertilizers across entire fields leads to staggering resource waste, soil degradation, and chemical runoff into vital ecosystems. This industrial-scale approach is blind to the micro-variations in soil health and plant needs, resulting in lower potential yields and significant ecological harm.

#### **Solution**

Symbient is a closed-loop, autonomous farming platform that reimagines a farm as a complex, living ecosystem. It deploys a swarm of **IoT sensors** to build a high-resolution "digital twin" of the farm's environment. A central **AI** analyzes this real-time data to make hyper-localized decisions, dispatching a fleet of **autonomous rovers** to deliver precise amounts of water, nutrients, or organic pest control on a plant-by-plant basis. This creates a symbiotic relationship between technology and nature, maximizing both yield and sustainability.

#### **‚ú® Feature List**

*   **üõ∞Ô∏è The IoT Sensor Swarm:**
    *   **Real-time Farm Digital Twin:** Creates a live, meter-by-meter map of the farm's soil and plant health.
    *   **Automated Pest & Disease Alerts:** AI-powered computer vision on drones identifies early signs of infestation before they are visible to the human eye.
    *   **Micro-Climate Monitoring:** Provides a granular understanding of environmental conditions across the entire farm.
*   **ü§ñ The Autonomous Rover Fleet:**
    *   **Plant-Level Precision Care:** Delivers water and nutrients directly to the root system of individual plants, eliminating waste.
    *   **Non-Chemical Weeding:** Rovers can be equipped with mechanical or laser-based tools to remove weeds without herbicides.
    *   **24/7 Autonomous Operation:** The fleet works around the clock, continuously tending to the farm and returning automatically to recharge and refill.
*   **üßë‚Äçüåæ The Farmer's Command Dashboard:**
    *   **High-Level Goal Setting:** Farmers define strategic goals (e.g., "prioritize water conservation") rather than micromanaging tasks.
    *   **Ecosystem Health Visualization:** An intuitive, at-a-glance view of the entire farm's condition, presented in dashboards powered by Grafana.
    *   **Actionable Sustainability Reports:** Provides clear, data-backed reports on water saved, chemical usage reduced, and yield improvements.
