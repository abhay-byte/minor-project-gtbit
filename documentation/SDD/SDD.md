## ðŸ“– Description  
This is the final task of the Software Design phase. The objective is to consolidate all the architectural and low-level design decisions and diagrams into a single, formal Software Design Document (SDD). This document will serve as the primary technical blueprint for the development team, defining how the Clinico platform will be built and guiding the entire implementation process.

---

## 1. Introduction  

The purpose of this Software Design Document (SDD) is to provide a detailed and structured design specification for the **Clinico - The Healing Hand Initiative** platform. It builds upon the requirements captured in the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** and translates them into an actionable technical framework for developers, testers, and other stakeholders.  

This document aims to:  
- Define the overall architecture and system components of the Clinico platform.  
- Outline the interaction between different modules and external systems.  
- Specify data models, workflows, and design decisions to ensure consistency in development.  
- Serve as a reference point for implementation, testing, and future maintenance.  

This SDD is derived directly from the specifications outlined in the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**. The SRS defines the *functional and non-functional requirements* of the system, while this SDD expands upon them to describe the *technical blueprint and design decisions*. For detailed requirements, readers may refer to the SRS document, which serves as the foundation for this design.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Pattern

The Clinico platform follows a **Microservices-style architecture** combined with **layered design principles**. This architectural choice provides modularity, scalability, maintainability, and ease of future extension.  

For all system architecture diagrams, see the [GitHub folder](https://github.com/abhay-byte/minor-project-gtbit/tree/main/documentation/diagrams/architecture).


**Key aspects of the architecture pattern:**

1. **Microservices Approach (Backend):**  
   - The backend is composed of multiple independent services, each handling a specific domain of the application:  
     - *AuthenticationService* for user management.  
     - *AppointmentService* for handling appointments.  
     - *ProfessionalService* for professional-specific operations.  
     - *DiscoveryService* for local clinic and doctor search.  
     - *AIGateway* and *AI_Agent_Service* for AI-related processing.  
   - Each service has its own responsibilities and communicates via well-defined interfaces, ensuring minimal coupling.  
   - Microservices can be deployed, scaled, and maintained independently, which improves the systemâ€™s reliability and resilience.  

2. **Client-Server Communication (Frontend â†” Backend):**  
   - The frontend applications (ClinicoApp and ClinicoDashboard) communicate with the backend services using a **Client-Server model**.  
   - Mobile and web clients act as *clients*, sending requests to the backend *server(s)* for data, business logic processing, and AI services.  
   - Communication occurs over secure channels (HTTPS/WSS), ensuring safe and reliable interaction.  
   - This design separates the user interface from server logic, providing flexibility for frontend development and multi-platform support.  

3. **Layered Design:**  
   - The system separates concerns across layers:  
     - **Presentation Layer:** Frontend applications that interact with users.  
     - **Application Layer:** Backend services handling business logic.  
     - **Data Layer:** Databases (PostgreSQL and Pinecone) that manage structured and AI-related data.  
   - This separation simplifies debugging, testing, and future enhancements.  

4. **Interfaces and Contracts:**  
   - Communication between components is formalized via **interfaces** (e.g., I_Auth, I_Appointments, I_AI_Chat).  
   - This ensures components are loosely coupled, making it easier to replace or upgrade individual services without affecting the entire system.  

5. **Scalability and Extensibility:**  
   - Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand.  
   - New services or features can be integrated without major changes to existing components.  

6. **Cloud-Native Deployment:**  
   - The architecture leverages cloud infrastructure for high availability and performance.  
   - Backend services, AI agents, and databases are deployed on cloud platforms (GCP/Render) ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable operation.  

**Rationale for the chosen architecture:**  
- **Modularity:** Facilitates independent development and easier maintenance.  
- **Scalability:** Services can scale based on load, e.g., AI services can be scaled separately.  
- **Resilience:** Failure of one service does not affect the entire platform.  
- **Flexibility:** Future features, new microservices, or external integrations can be added with minimal impact.  
- **Security:** Critical components like AI services and authentication are isolated, reducing the attack surface.  

> **Note:** The following Component and Deployment Diagrams illustrate the structure and deployment strategy of the Clinico platform. They are linked to the source files, so any updates made to these diagrams will automatically reflect here, ensuring the SDD always stays up-to-date.

## 2.2 Component Diagram (Detailed)

The Component Diagram provides a high-level view of the Clinico system, emphasizing modularity, separation of concerns, and interactions between components. It visually maps how frontend applications, backend services, AI agents, and databases interact to deliver system functionality. This design promotes a clean separation of concerns and a scalable, microservices-style architecture.

## 2.3 Deployment Diagram

### Deployment Diagram

The Deployment Diagram provides a comprehensive view of the **systemâ€™s physical and cloud-based deployment architecture**. It not only specifies the **hardware and software environments** where different components of the system reside but also clarifies the **interactions between client-side devices, backend servers, databases, and third-party services**.

This diagram bridges the gap between the **logical design** (how the system is structured functionally) and the **physical infrastructure** (how it is actually deployed and operated). It captures:

1. **Nodes (Execution Environments):**
   - Physical devices such as user smartphones and professional computers.
   - Virtual/cloud nodes such as Google Cloud App Engine instances, managed databases, and external APIs.

2. **Artifacts (Deployed Software Units):**
   - Mobile application packages (APK), web application bundles, backend services, AI microservices, and database instances.

3. **Communication Paths:**
   - Secure channels (HTTPS/WSS) between user devices and cloud servers.
   - Internal API calls between backend services and AI agents.
   - Data exchange between application servers and databases.
   - Interactions with third-party APIs such as Firebase (for notifications) and Google Maps (for geolocation).

By visualizing these aspects, the Deployment Diagram highlights **how the system operates in real-world conditions**â€”which services run on which platforms, how they are distributed across devices and cloud infrastructure, and how they communicate securely and efficiently. This ensures that the design is not only functionally sound but also **deployable, scalable, and maintainable** in a production environment.

The **Object Diagram** provides a *snapshot* of the system at a specific moment in time. Unlike the Class Diagram, which shows abstract classes and their relationships, the Object Diagram illustrates actual **instances of objects** with their **attribute values** and **runtime links**.  

In this example, the Object Diagram demonstrates a real-world use case:  
- A patient named **Abhay Raj** books a **virtual appointment** with a professional psychiatrist, **Dr. Bhumika**.  
- The diagram captures the state of the system at that specific point in time, showing object attributes and the associations that connect them.  

This diagram is mainly used to:  
- **Validate the Class Diagram** by showing concrete examples.  
- **Visualize runtime data** and how classes are instantiated.  
- **Confirm relationships and constraints** in a practical scenario.

1. **abhay_user: User**  
   - Attributes:  
     - `fullName = "Abhay Raj"`  
     - `role = Patient`  
   - Represents the general user information for the patient.  

2. **abhay_patient: Patient**  
   - Attributes:  
     - `patientId = 201`  
   - Specialization of the User class, representing patient-specific details.  

3. **bhumika_user: User**  
   - Attributes:  
     - `fullName = "Dr. Bhumika"`  
     - `role = Professional`  
   - Represents the general user information for the professional.  

4. **bhumika_prof: Professional**  
   - Attributes:  
     - `professionalId = 301`  
     - `specialty = "Psychiatrist"`  
   - Specialization of the User class, representing professional-specific details.  

5. **appointment_401: Appointment**  
   - Attributes:  
     - `status = Scheduled`  
     - `type = Virtual`  
     - `appointmentTime = "2025-11-15T14:00Z"`  
   - Represents a scheduled appointment between the patient and the professional.  

---

### 2. **Links (Relationships Between Objects)**  

The following associations connect the objects at runtime:  

- **Link 1:** `abhay_user â†’ abhay_patient`  
  - Shows that the user object *Abhay Raj* is also represented as a patient with an ID.  

- **Link 2:** `bhumika_user â†’ bhumika_prof`  
  - Shows that the user object *Dr. Bhumika* is also represented as a professional with a specialty.  

- **Link 3:** `abhay_patient â†’ appointment_401`  
  - Labeled **+books**  
  - Indicates that the patient *Abhay* has booked the appointment.  

- **Link 4:** `bhumika_prof â†’ appointment_401`  
  - Labeled **+conducts**  
  - Indicates that the professional *Dr. Bhumika* is conducting the appointment.  

---

### Key Insights  

- The diagram highlights the **runtime state** of the system for a booking event.  
- It validates the **Class Diagram logic** by demonstrating how:  
  - A User can be specialized into Patient or Professional.  
  - Patients can book appointments.  
  - Professionals can conduct appointments.  
- The **Object Diagram** makes the abstract model concrete by including real data values such as `"Abhay Raj"`, `"Dr. Bhumika"`, and the scheduled appointment time.  

---

### Importance in Low-Level Design  

- Ensures that the system design supports real-world use cases.  
- Provides a **bridge** between the high-level conceptual Class Diagram and actual system execution.  
- Useful for **testing, validation, and walkthroughs** with stakeholders, as it is easy to understand.

# 3.1.5 State-chart Diagram  

## 3.1.5.1 Overview  
The **State-chart Diagram** models the **complete lifecycle of a critical object** in the system. In this project, the focus is on the **Appointment** object, which is central to the telehealth platform.  

An appointment progresses through several states, starting from its creation (Scheduled) to its termination (Completed or Cancelled). During this lifecycle, different events (triggers) such as booking, cancellation, or doctorâ€™s note submission cause transitions from one state to another.  

Key purposes of the State-chart Diagram are:  
- To **visualize how the system behaves over time** as appointments move through their lifecycle.  
- To **capture all possible states** an appointment can be in (Scheduled, In_Progress, Completed, Cancelled).  
- To **define the events and guards** that cause valid state transitions.  
- To **incorporate internal activities** such as sending notifications or generating summaries when entering certain states.  

This diagram ensures that the appointment lifecycle is **consistent, predictable, and complete**, leaving no ambiguity in system behavior.

## 3.1.5.2 Diagram  
![Appointment State-chart Diagram](https://github.com/abhay-byte/minor-project-gtbit/blob/main/documentation/diagrams/low-level-design/statechart_diagram_appointment.png)  

---

## 3.1.5.3 Explanation  

### 3.1.5.3.1 States  
The **Appointment** object goes through the following states:  

1. **Initial State**  
   - Represents the starting point before the appointment is created.  

2. **Scheduled (Simple State)**  
   - Appointment has been successfully booked but not yet started.  
   - Entry Action: `sendConfirmationNotifications()` (patient and doctor are notified).  

3. **In_Progress (Composite State)**  
   - Represents the **ongoing process of a virtual consultation**.  
   - Contains multiple internal states (sub-states).  

4. **Completed (Simple State)**  
   - Appointment successfully finished.  
   - Entry Action: `generateConsultationSummary()` (system prepares a summary for records and patient view).  

5. **Cancelled (Simple State)**  
   - Appointment was cancelled either by patient or doctor.  
   - Entry Action: `sendCancellationNotifications()` (system notifies stakeholders).  

6. **Final State**  
   - Represents the termination of the lifecycle.  
   - Appointment can reach here either after **Completed** or **Cancelled**.  

---

### 3.1.5.3.2 The In_Progress Composite State  
The **In_Progress** state is not a single action; it represents a **process** broken down into steps. Inside this composite state:  

1. **Initial State (inside In_Progress)** â€“ entry point when appointment time starts.  
2. **Waiting for Participants** â€“ patient and doctor are waiting to join the consultation call.  
3. **Consultation Active** â€“ both participants are present, and the telehealth consultation is ongoing.  
4. **Finalizing Notes** â€“ the consultation has ended, and the doctor is finalizing notes and prescriptions.  
5. **Final State (internal)** â€“ marks the completion of sub-activities inside In_Progress.  

---

### 3.1.5.3.3 Transitions and Triggers  

#### Main State Transitions  
1. **Initial â†’ Scheduled**  
   - Trigger: `patient books appointment`  
   - Effect: `createRecord()`  

2. **Scheduled â†’ In_Progress**  
   - Trigger: `appointment time starts`  

3. **Scheduled â†’ Cancelled**  
   - Trigger: `patient cancels` OR `doctor cancels`  
   - Guard: `[before appointment time]`  

4. **In_Progress â†’ Cancelled**  
   - Trigger: `patient is no-show`  
   - Guard: `[after grace period]`  
   - Effect: `logNoShow()`  

5. **In_Progress â†’ Completed**  
   - Trigger: `doctor finalizes notes`  

6. **Cancelled â†’ Final State**  
   - Automatic transition (no additional trigger).  

7. **Completed â†’ Final State**  
   - Automatic transition (no additional trigger).  

---

#### Transitions inside In_Progress  
1. **Initial (inside In_Progress) â†’ Waiting for Participants**  
   - Automatic transition.  

2. **Waiting for Participants â†’ Consultation Active**  
   - Trigger: `all participants join call`  

3. **Consultation Active â†’ Finalizing Notes**  
   - Trigger: `call ends`  

4. **Finalizing Notes â†’ Final State (inside In_Progress)**  
   - Effect: `notifySystemOfCompletion()`  

*Note:* The **main external transition** from In_Progress â†’ Completed happens when the doctor saves notes, while the **internal final state** only represents the end of sub-activities.  

---

### 3.1.5.3.4 Internal Activities (Entry/Exit)  
Each state can have **entry activities** that the system performs automatically when entering the state:  

- **Scheduled**:  
  - Entry: `sendConfirmationNotifications()`  

- **Completed**:  
  - Entry: `generateConsultationSummary()`  

- **Cancelled**:  
  - Entry: `sendCancellationNotifications()`  

---

## 3.1.5.4 Insights  

- The State-chart diagram captures **all possible states** of an appointment lifecycle.  
- It provides clarity on **how cancellations, no-shows, or completions are handled**.  
- Composite states like **In_Progress** allow detailed modeling of sub-activities (joining call, active consultation, finalizing notes).  
- Guards (`before appointment time`, `after grace period`) ensure that only **valid transitions** are allowed.  
- Entry actions guarantee **important system notifications and record updates** happen at the right time.  

---

## 3.1.5.5 Importance of State-chart Diagram  

- Ensures **robust lifecycle management** of appointments.  
- Prevents the system from entering **invalid or undefined states**.  
- Provides developers a **blueprint for implementing state management** in code.  
- Serves as a **validation tool** to check if all real-world scenarios (cancellation, no-show, successful completion) are supported.  
- Helps testers design **test cases for state transitions** and edge conditions.  

---
# 4. Data Design  

## 4.1 What is Data Design?

# 5. Conclusion  

This document marks the completion of the **Software Design phase** for the **Clinico Telehealth Platform**. It consolidates all architectural and low-level design decisions into a single, formal **Software Design Document (SDD)**, which now serves as the **primary technical blueprint** for the development team.  

Through the structured sections of this SDD, we have:  
- Defined the **system architecture**, including Component and Deployment Diagrams, to illustrate the overall structure and deployment environment.  
- Captured the **low-level design** with detailed Class, Object, Sequence, Activity, and State-chart diagrams, ensuring both structural clarity and behavioral accuracy.  
- Documented the **data design** by embedding the ER Diagram, justifying the choice of PostgreSQL, and creating a comprehensive data dictionary that secures data integrity, scalability, and compliance.  

Together, these artifacts bridge the gap between the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** and the **implementation phase**, ensuring:  
- Developers have a clear roadmap for building each module.  
- Testers can validate workflows, transitions, and data consistency.  
- Stakeholders can trust that business requirements have been translated into robust technical solutions.  

This SDD will remain a **living document** throughout development, guiding decisions, maintaining alignment with requirements, and supporting scalable enhancements in the future. With this foundation, the Clinico platform is prepared for successful implementation, testing, and real-world adoption.
