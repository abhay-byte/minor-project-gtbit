## 6.4. Infrastructure Architecture

### 6.4.1. Cloud Infrastructure Architecture (Using App Engine)

The Clinico platform is built on a scalable, secure, and serverless foundation using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. Our approach prioritizes rapid development and automated management by leveraging **Google App Engine**.

- **Compute Platform**: Google App Engine with a Flexible Environment  
  - **Description**: Our backend (Node.js) and AI (Python) microservices are packaged as standard Docker containers. We deploy these containers directly to App Engine. This provides a serverless experience where Google automatically manages the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and load balancing based on traffic, while still giving us the portability of Docker.  

- **Service Communication**: App Engine Services Discovery  
  - **Description**: Each microservice (e.g., *clinico-backend*, *clinico-ai-service*) is deployed as a separate "service" within the same App Engine application. This allows them to communicate with each other securely and efficiently over a private internal network using stable service URLs (e.g., `ai-service-dot-your-project-id.appspot.com`), without needing a complex service mesh like Istio.  

- **API Gateway**: Google Cloud Endpoints with App Engine integration  
  - **Description**: All incoming traffic from the Flutter app and React dashboard is routed through Cloud Endpoints. This provides a single, secure entry point for our system, handling authentication (JWT validation), rate limiting, and protection against common web threats before forwarding requests to the appropriate App Engine service.  

- **Monitoring & Logging**: Google Cloud's Operations Suite (Cloud Logging & Error Reporting)  
  - **Description**: App Engine is natively integrated with Cloud Logging and Error Reporting. All `console.log` outputs from our Node.js service and logs from our Python service are automatically collected, centralized, and searchable. Error Reporting automatically captures and alerts us on any application crashes.  

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Google Cloud Build triggered by GitHub Webhooks  
  - **Description**: Our deployment process is fully automated. When new code is pushed to our main branch on GitHub, a webhook triggers a Cloud Build pipeline. This pipeline automatically runs tests, builds our Docker images, and deploys the new versions directly to our App Engine services with zero downtime using traffic splitting.  


---

### 6.4.2. Security Architecture  

Security is a foundational aspect of the Clinico platform, especially when handling sensitive health data.  

- **Network Security**: Google Cloud VPC, Firewall Rules, and Network Segmentation  
  - **Description**: Our services run within a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), isolated from the public internet. Strict firewall rules ensure that services can only communicate on approved ports. The database is in a separate, private subnet with no direct internet access.  

- **Identity & Access Management**: Custom JWT Implementation with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
  - **Description**: All authenticated API requests require a valid JSON Web Token (JWT). The backend validates the token's signature and uses the role claim (*Patient*, *Professional*, etc.) to enforce strict permissions, ensuring users can only access the data and actions they are authorized for.  

- **Secrets Management**: Google Secret Manager  
  - **Description**: All sensitive credentials, such as database passwords and API keys, are stored securely in Google Secret Manager. Our applications retrieve these secrets at runtime, meaning they are never hardcoded in our source code.  

- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated Security Scanning  
  - **Description**: We use automated tools within our CI/CD pipeline to scan our Docker images for known vulnerabilities and our code for common security flaws before deployment.  

---

### 6.4.3. External Integrations  

The platform integrates with several best-in-class, managed third-party services to provide core functionalities:  

- **AI Engine**: Google Vertex AI for hosting and serving the Gemini models.  
- **Location Services**: Google Maps Platform API for hyperlocal search, mapping, and geolocation.  
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending real-time appointment reminders and alerts.  
- **Video Communication**: WebRTC for secure, peer-to-peer, real-time video and audio streaming during consultations.  


### 6.4.4. Project Source & Documentation  
- **Source Code Repository**: The complete source code for this project is open-source and hosted on GitHub  
  - **URL**: [https://github.com/abhay-byte/minor-project-gtbit](https://github.com/abhay-byte/minor-project-gtbit)  
  - **Open Source**: This project is licensed under the **MIT License**. We encourage contributions and collaboration from the community.  

- **Project Documentation**:  
  All planning, design, and architectural documents, including diagrams and API specifications, are maintained within the `/documentation` folder of the main repository.
