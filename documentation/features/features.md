### **III. Hyperlocal Care Discovery**

#### **Concept**

This feature provides users with a powerful, map-based interface to find, compare, and connect with verified doctors, clinics, and hospitals in their immediate vicinity. It transforms the Clinico app into a one-stop solution for both teleconsultation and in-person healthcare, ensuring users can always find the right care, right now.

#### **A. User Interface & Experience**

1.  **Interactive Map View:**
    *   Upon opening the feature, a map interface immediately centers on the user's current location (with their permission).
    *   Clinics and hospitals are displayed as distinct, color-coded pins (e.g., blue for individual clinics, green for hospitals).
    *   The map uses intelligent clustering, showing a single pin with a number in dense areas, which expands upon zooming in.
    *   Tapping a pin reveals a quick-view card with the name, specialty, overall rating, and distance.

2.  **Comprehensive List View:**
    *   Users can toggle from the map to a scrollable list view, which displays all nearby healthcare options.
    *   This view allows for easy sorting by distance, patient rating, or consultation fee.

3.  **Unified Profile Pages:**
    *   Clicking on any entry (from map or list) opens a detailed profile page. The structure is intelligently designed to handle both individual clinics and multi-specialty hospitals.

#### **B. Detailed Information & Data Points Displayed**

**1. For Individual Clinic Profiles:**
*   **Clinic Name & Photos:** High-quality images of the facility.
*   **Doctor's Profile:** Name, qualifications (e.g., MBBS, MD), and years of experience.
*   **Specialty:** Clearly defined (e.g., General Physician, Dermatologist, Pediatrician).
*   **Consultation Fee Range:** A clear indication of the cost (e.g., ₹500 - ₹800).
*   **Overall Clinic Rating:** An aggregated star rating (e.g., 4.5/5) based on verified patient reviews.
*   **Patient Reviews:** A scrollable list of detailed, verified reviews from other Clinico users.
*   **Services Offered:** A checklist of services available (e.g., Vaccinations, Minor Procedures, Lab Tests).
*   **Languages Spoken.**
*   **Operating Hours & Address:** With one-tap navigation via Google Maps/Apple Maps.

**2. For Hospital Profiles:**
*   **Hospital Name & Photos:** Images of the hospital, its infrastructure, and key departments.
*   **List of Departments:** A searchable list of all available departments (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics, Neurology).
*   **Directory of Available Doctors:** This is the key feature. Within the hospital profile, users can see a list of individual doctors, each with their own:
    *   **Photo, Name, and Specialty.**
    *   **Specific Consultation Fee.**
    *   **Individual Doctor Rating** (based on patient reviews).
    *   **Availability/Schedule.**
*   **Hospital Amenities:** Information on 24/7 emergency services, pharmacy, in-patient facilities, etc.

#### **C. Core Functionality & Smart Filters**

This is where the feature's power lies, allowing users to instantly narrow down their options.

*   **Filter by Specialty:** The primary filter, allowing users to search for anything from a "Dentist" to a "Neurosurgeon."
*   **Filter by Location & Radius:** An adjustable slider (e.g., within 2km, 5km, 10km) to define the search area.
*   **Filter by Consultation Fee:** A price range slider to find options that fit the user's budget.
*   **Filter by Patient Rating:** Show only options with a rating of 4 stars and above.
*   **Filter by Availability:** A powerful filter to show doctors who have open slots for booking **"Today"** or **"This Week."**

#### **D. Deep Integration with the Clinico Ecosystem**

This feature is not a standalone tool; it is deeply woven into the platform's core value proposition.

1.  **Hybrid Booking System:**
    *   For any doctor listed, the user will see clear options: **"Book In-Person Visit"** or **"Book Teleconsultation"** (if the doctor also offers virtual services through Clinico). This provides ultimate flexibility.
2.  **Unified Health Records:**
    *   After an in-person visit, the user is prompted to scan and upload their physical prescription and lab reports directly into their Clinico **Digital Health Records Vault**, maintaining a complete health history in one place.
3.  **The Telehealth Safety Net:**
    *   This is a crucial enhancement. If a user searches for a specialist (e.g., a "Rheumatologist") and no results are found within their set radius, the system will automatically display a message: ***"No local Rheumatologists found. Would you like to connect with a top-rated specialist via video consultation right now?"*** This seamlessly funnels the user back to the platform's core telehealth service, ensuring no need goes unmet.
4.  **Verified Post-Visit Feedback:**
    *   After a completed in-person appointment booked through Clinico, the user receives a prompt to rate their experience and leave a review, ensuring all ratings are from genuine patients.
