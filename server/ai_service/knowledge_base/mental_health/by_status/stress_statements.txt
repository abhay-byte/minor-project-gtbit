EXAMPLE STATEMENTS
1. No, not really. I thanked my boyfriend, and then immediately blurted out "how am I going to explain this to my mother?" Like I said, he's understanding, but I could see him kinda wince as he probably realized that the gifts brought me more anxiety than happiness. **I spent the next half hour desperately thinking up backstories I could use to explain to my mother why I had a brand new hat. **
2. Trying to improve my life So I'm 33 and I'll be 34 in March. Right now I'm working at McDonald's but I'm having issues with scheduling so I'm looking for another job. I do have an AAS but I never used it so I'm tryna get back into school or into a certification program but I don't wanna end up in debt. I keep wondering where I'll end up cuz I do wanna move but I don't drive so I'm tryna get an ebike but I still wanna move out of this city (I'm in Ohio) I just keep wondering if I can get ahead in life. I know I'm taking the right steps by working and thinking of school but it's still stressful cuz I'm tryna think ahead but maybe I'm thinking too much about it 😔 anybody else feel like this?
4. Venting Sorry if this isn't appropriate for here, but the stress is killing me. I'm 24 and I feel like I've got the stress of a 45 year old going through a midlife crisis! 

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time. 

Again, if this isn't the place, I apologize. Just looking for others in a similar mess, maybe I'm looking for some words of reassurance. Don't know, but thank you to anyone who fully reads this rambling
5. My troubles began when I confronted her about withdrawing large and frequent amounts of cash from her account and asked her what she was spending all that money on when she wasn't paying for my siblings. I asked her for my 9 year old sister's dad number , so I could bring up her not spending the child support money she was receiving on my sister. She refused to give me his number and since then I cannot even talk to her. She has even told me not to take my sister out with me and my brother because she says she does not have money to pay me back. If i mention anything about what I spend on them she say "I need to see a receipt" but when I ask if she bought anything for them and to show me a receipt she says "Of course I don't keep them".
6. Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work). Is this something a service dog would be helpful for? Or does it have to be a lot worse than that? Sorry if it's a weird question, it's just something I've been thinking about.
7. I got extremely stressed in workplace and home. To speak I live in South East Asia, where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.

I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.

I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

Sorry it's more of a rant post, but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it? I felt like I could explode at any point right now.
8. She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling. I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved? Thank you for reading and I appreciate any and all responses.
9. Transport Your Mindset to a Calm Soothing place, Ambient Music for Deep ... stay calm
10. it wasn't my fault it feels like my fault I feel like the reason That mother shouldn't have had to bury her boy I should have been a better friend
11. I feel like I can’t get rid of stress because it has benefitted me my whole life. Stress and anxiety has made me successful in the things that I do. But I’m also worried I may be stressing too much. Any advice on how I can get rid of stress even though I feel like I need it?
12. I'm having a rough time right now and going through some things where my anxiety and depression keep dragging me down. My roommates have not really experienced someone with anxiety before really. At least not someone who gets attacks. During the recovery of one of my episodes, I came up with this writing in the notes of my iPhone. So here it is.
13. Not capable of relaxing? Hi you all, my problem is i would like to pursue more creative hobbies like drawing but 90% of the times i feel i can't because i am too stressed for something (i am in uni now, so it is alternating between lessons and exams). That something being too mentally tired for doing anything else rather the watching the phone or the tv, or being too mentally tired because of studying. I am sure someone else has encountered this problem. How you solve this?
14. Stressed about my Stress Test! I have my first stress test in a few hours and I'm getting pretty nervous. I have a chronic migraine condition that gets triggered by exercise of any kind. My BP is 130/90 avg, down from 16/110 (thanks Losartan!) and my heart rate is averaging 120bpm, but it's also down from 140bpm. 

Should I bring someone with me? How strenuous does it get? I'll be in a hospital in case anything goes wrong, but the drive home is 20 minutes. 

Thanks 🙏
15. It was no longer just about the life and love we were building together. It was no longer about us, it was about me and trying to fill this hole within myself. If she would just want me, make me feel wanted, I could baptize myself in it and finally let go of all this guilt and self-hatred. This male shame. It’s complicated.
16. He loves them and treats them like gold. I love the type of father he is but I hate the way he treats me. I have no one to open up to or go to if I even tried to leave him. I’m tired of him abusing me mentally and physically me. He has cheated on me several times and each time it knocks my self esteem Lower and lower.
17. Is this stress? Get these weird symptoms in the morning when I wake up until mid day ish. Regardless of how much sleep I’ve had.

-Tension all over face (mostly in head, like a small tension headache, above eye, and in jaw)

-Keep tensing jaw and grinding teeth together

-Losing focus 

Any help would be appreciated.
18. Again, I worry they'll say that if I'm sexually active, I should be able to do this just fine. -Could I get them to only not leave the room or open the door where someone walking by could see me? -Could I ask them to tell me everything as they're doing it? So I'm somewhat prepared for everything? -Could I get them to stop if I need it?
19. Stress Survey  Hey everyone! I am conducting some research on stress levels among college students. I'm a student myself and this is my first time conducting a study myself so I'm really sorry if my survey isn't the best. I would really appriciate if people would take my survey on stress! Everything is anonymous, I just need as much data as possible to help move my study along. If everyone is interested, I can post my results here when the study is done.

20. Math grade Just got my heavy assessment back today, got an F on it. I studied real hard for math, but I still failed. I really feel like I’m a moron, and I just checked my grade, it went from B to D+. Sometimes I wonder if my dream about the future is realistic or not. I feel like I have no motivation to be productive again. I really don’t want to fail my parents and my dreams, but my grades just stress me out so much. I need a good grade for this semester or idk where I will end up in in the future. Any advice on how I should get myself together again?
21. This is something I'm working on figuring out for myself). Option 2: We each move after we each get a job in City A. Drawbacks: (1) one of us will be left at our current job for a while with our boss and coworkers knowing the other is likely to leave soon after. I'm not sure if this is an inadvisable situation. (2) BF will likely find a job first, as he has a few more years experience than me plus some management experience.
22. just realised my sickness is stress related I can barely move from the nausea, my whole body is heavy and my head feels musty, it feels like the flu I can barely stand up for 10 minutes without feeling violently ill. The thing is, I need to pack to move out today and I've got about half of it to go. I just want to sleep and run away from it all but I can't. I'm exhausted, I've had to clean out all my moms stuff and decide on a place within a month (she died recently and I'm 18). The pressure from everyone to sell the house fast is killing me.

It's not logical, or not practical. Well it's not what everyone else expects of me anyway. So I need some help in managing this sickness so I can get stuff done.
23. I instantly thought of something I rarely think about, being molested in a pool locker room when I was 10. My heart started beating incredibly fast as I readied myself to tell them the thing I couldn’t even tell my family at the time. I started crying, something I haven’t done in years and something my friends have never seen me do. When it got to me, with my hand over my eyes all I could say was “I don’t think I can”. It felt like I was reliving what I’d gone through, like I could see it happening in front of me.
24. After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman. He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past. I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship. It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency. I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.
25. The little things Hello,

Does anyone else feel like they’re constantly getting stressed out by the little things?

It seems like every day, there will be something to stress me out. The smallest things can bother me so much. I just get frustrated and upset when anything goes the least bit wrong, or when something doesn’t work properly, or whatever. 

It just gets so difficult to do anything, to focus on anything, without getting stressed and anxious, and I get a headache.
26. My mother has stage 4 bile duct cancer and it seems like her time is limited. She has a $5k insurance policy but I know that's not going to be enough. I've had to take a lot of time off work to take care of her and I just don't have the money to pay for what the insurance won't cover. What are some resources I can use to help pay for this? She does not want to be cremated and there's no way I could do that against her wishes just to save money.
27. What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**
28. It sorta works, but I don't like the feeling of being deadheaded. I also don't have a good relationships with doctors considering I was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen and given lithium... Had a terrible reaction to it. What are some more natural remedies or self-help you all do to keep yourself in the proper mindset to calm your triggers? I've started meditation and taking CBD oil (which work great, but kinda expensive), but it doesn't seem to be enough. I just want to start living and be able to enjoy life.
29. He's not seeing a therapist or psych regularly, which we agreed that he needed to be doing if he was going off his meds. I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself, even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication. Though things are as normal as they can be right now, I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him, like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess), because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway). Well it still ended up being long, my apologies! What should I even do from here?
30. Every day I hope she messages me, calls me, or post on my Facebook. Any advice would mean the world to me. Thank you.   ---   **tl;dr - can't get over my ex**: How to get over my ex!
32. My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore. Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep? Every time? My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse. How long until I start to see improvements?
33. How stress alone has potentially ruined my physical health . Last year alone . I stressed a lot . I actually told myself I’m so stressed . I feel like I could die from this level of stress . Well it almost got me . 

Start of last year . 
- stress induced stomach ulcer 

4 months later 
- stress induced IBS 

6 months later 
- started grinding my teeth 

8 months later 
- teeth grinding now caused tinnitus , ear pain , jaw pain . 

So because of stress I have facial pain , stomach pain , intestines issues , worn teeth and worst of all 24/7 tinnitus and ear pain . 

Stress is no joke . Look after yourself
34. I’ve been leaving lights on at night both in the main rooms and my bedroom. The fear is both physical and emotional. I’m so jumpy at work and at home. I feel like I’m seeing things everywhere and little waves of panic wash through me all day. I’m really just finding this incredibly difficult right now and needed to write it out I guess.
35. I began experiencing "anxiety attacks" around 2 weeks ago, and have had 3 since, with the latest one being last night. So the first time I was at the dining hall and all of a sudden all the voices around me began to seem echoey and I had a spike of that warm panicky feeling in my body. I quickly got up to put my plate on the dumbwaiter and left the dining hall and it subsided fairly quickly, I didn't really think much of it. The second time was the following Saturday, where when I got back to my dorm I experienced discomfort/malaise from seemingly nothing, no triggers, nothing, just feeling uncomfortable and anxious. This laster for around 30 minutes.
36. I have been thinking about it and I think that all anxiety seems to boil down to either fear of what other people think of you or fear of death. I am curious if this is just me? Sometimes simplifying it makes it easier for me to deal with, at least during less intense moments where I still have control of my mind. I realize a fear of death is a bit unbeatable, but some how that seems to give me a bit of peace. The one that I have a hell of a time with is fear of what other people thinking.
37. Stressed out having trouble coming down from it I run a medium sized company and we are very successful. But I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks, and my body doesn’t handle a lot of stress well. It may be the thing that removes me from the position I’m currently in. 

The desk job and stress has not been kind to my body. 

I bought some noise cancelling headphones to use during stressful times and will see if it helps when I want to sort of meditate while at work. 

Does anyone have any tips?
38. he could not understand why i resented him, when in his mind, it was ME who was being 'abusive'. because i couldnt fake being into sex with him, which made me a 'bad girlfriend', because i wasn't ecstatic about always having to take on every responsibility and basically take care of him as if he were a child. he constantly told me that i was just playing the victim, when it reality it was really him who actually was the victim. i was the 'bad person' in the relationship. WELL FUCK YOU.
39. How to Take Criticism Effectively So I struggle with criticism. On the moment I'm contradicted on a subject, I doubt just about everything I know. It's a huge problem. I will become extremely anxious and self pity, if I don't get defensive. Typically if someone else is wrong or criticized even at the smallest degree at a similar time, it's like instant relief, but that isn't a given. How should I learn to take criticism so I'm actually a better person from it?
40. Looking for techniques to help with stress I am aware of the common things like exercise, meditation, breathing exercises. These don’t seem to help me enough and I’m curious if there was something someone tried and maybe were surprised it helped their stress. Thanks so much in advance.
41. The best idea i have came up with is use the lazt of my petrol to get somewhere atleazt half close to work and safe and legal to park up where i canalso sleep. Use my anti bactiral gel to clean my body and just wear a hat all week for work and wait it out until friday. Does anyone else have any better advice? Id appriciate any suggestions. Thank you

43. I'm a senior and  I'm starting to go through the college application process and I just feel so overwhelmed. I haven't even finished my college list, started ny essays or supplemental or filed my FAFSA. Not to mention I'm doing EA so I have a sooner deadline. I haven't visited any colleges and me ecs are so bad. God I just want this to be over with.
44. It sucks. I know I need help. I want to get help. I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer). I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.
45. Now I know everyone is going to maybe think it's from the suboxone but it or at least used to be one of the things that helped my anxiety. If I admitted myself I am afraid they'd admit me and make me go cold turkey. I am unemployed and looking for employment. I live with my grandparents. I'm a 28 year old male.

47. I just- Paid for a “massage” so id stop feeling so lonely. It actually helped a bit. We had a moment where we were just relaxing. It was the best part of it. 

Crazy how in a world full of billions of people you can feel so alone. I find that to be ludicrous. Don’t you? 

Something is seriously wrong in the world.
48. I don’t know how to make him leave because he says if I do that he will go and dispute all the charges I ever made on his debit card and say it was fraud and he will have me prosecuted. In the past when we were together I stupidly sent him private photos of myself and he threatens to send them to my church, my parents, and my bosses. He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now he’s saying I’m lying). I feel like he literally dictates my life. He breaks things in my apartment.

50. I desperately need a car and found a great opportunity but the previous owner died of a heart attack in it. Thats my number one cause of anxiety, the fear of heart attacks.
