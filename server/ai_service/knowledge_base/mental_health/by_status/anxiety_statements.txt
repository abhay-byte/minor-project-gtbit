EXAMPLE STATEMENTS
1. My anxiety is telling me not to be honest/vulnerable I have a second date (anxiety is also telling me it’s not a date and that I’m not of interest to anyone other than people that try to take advantage of me.) with someone next week. I am so excited because the first date was a /blast/. My anxiety is telling me to play it cool, and not to look too eager and to only express interest if they express 
interest first.

I would have listened in the past.

I think it would be in my best interest to tell them I’m looking forward to it because I am. 

So, I am going to tell them that I’m excited to see them next week. Better to be myself and turn-off someone that isn’t interested in my genuine excitement to spend time with them than it is to keep pretending.
2. Worried I have ovarian cancer. The more I'm on social media the more I hear about 'silent killer' cancers. I read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. I feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and I often have a bloated stomach. I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. I also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that I'm fine and then I'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane.
3. For HA Sufferers with different anxieties than mine... I have very distinct HA fears (STI’s namely) so whenever someone talks about brain tumors or aneurysm’s I just can’t relate. This is refreshing because it reminds me of how other people feel when they hear me talk about my complex theories of how I might be ill. This isn’t minimizing what anyone else is saying, but this forum does provide me with a really good perspective on my own issues. Thank you to everyone who is willing to be vulnerable on here... having HA is painful, and opening up about it is even more painful.
4. Eye floaters from stress? Hello, I recently went through an eye exam and my eyes checked out healthy enough (I have a prescription for nearsightedness) but they’ve been around for about 3 weeks now and idk if I should be as worried as I am.
5. There is excessive anxiety today, .And, there is another.
6. how did buspirone/buspar make you feel? did you take it consistently or only as needed? hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed, but after all the research ive done, this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed, if it's not a fast/immediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time, right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course, but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically, and whether you took it as needed or daily. 

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion. 

thanks friends :)
7. Why is it that if there are a lot of people talking in front of the house, there are too many motorbikes that pass by, the feeling is immediately restless, afraid, gt
8. I need adit not for stalking or for strange things because I myself have started to learn not to stalk just because I'm afraid that mental disorders will get worse even though I still feel anxious and afraid if I don't stalk, I can hold it so that Adit doesn't feel disturbed
9. Fuck lymph nodes I spent about two months completely paranoid about lymph nodes under my jaw before I discovered they were actually just part of the muscles in my neck. And now I've just discovered that a lymph node on the side of my neck is swollen despite feeling no symptoms at all and I'm freaking out all over again. You look on the internet and it's all HIV, cancer etc.

 I also live in a country where I can't speak the language and need someone with ID to help me go to the hospital, but I feel terrible about constantly asking my girlfriend to go when I don't even really feel physically ill just to discover it's apparently nothing. I've had health anxiety basically all my life but the past six months have been crazy.
10. confused and restless. This heart seems to die. When you change
11. Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.
12. Helpful starter links for dealing with Health Anxiety **EDIT: I have found all the modules, a long with the parent link. I have now included all of them for you :)**

I, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  I have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet I am still unconvinced, a feeling I'm sure many of you can relate to.

&amp;nbsp;

So tonight (since it's a Sunday and I can't call my doctor yet again :p), I decided to look for some self help. Through a google search I came across these .pdfs that have already brought some comfort to me, in the short few minutes I've been working with them.  Apparently, there are 9 modules, but I have only been able to locate modules 1-3, 6, and 8-9 (missing 4, 5, and 7).  I am going to keep searching for the rest of them, in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness, but for now, I'd figure I'd share these with you, friends.  Hopefully they help to bring some comfort to you.

Good luck, friends. Hopefully these help.  If you happen to come across the missing modules, post them and I will add them to OP.

We will get through this
13. I’m not super paranoid, but could I be pregnant? So - let me preface this with saying I AM on the pill. I’m too paranoid not to use it, and take it faithfully. Haven’t taken it late since week 1 and it’s currently week 3. It’s the combo pill.
Secondly, why this gives me anxiety - I’m NOT ready to be pregnant. It’s not the right time for me.

So basically my boyfriend and I did the deed (today) with a condom, but it broke. I’ve been having PMS cramps since around Monday, and my period is due in exactly a week. Is it worth investing in the Plan B pill?
14. Very worried
15. Actually I'm worried. The original looks really scared. I've come to play/bite my nails :(
16. Sometimes it's your own thoughts that make you anxious and afraid to close your eyes until you don't sleep
17. My health anxiety caused me to get a CT scan and now my anxiety is in overdrive over radiation risks I am a hypochondriac but this time I have been having some severe abdominal pain for 2 weeks. It's constant, not one second of peace, sleeping is very difficult. I've visited doctors, blood tests are normal. I even managed to do an endoscopy, which has always been one of my worst nightmares. It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. I've been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isn't much wrong, just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad I've irradiated myself for nothing (although, I don't really regret it, never had such pain in my life). The risk is like a 0,2% increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless it's an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so that's why I didn't get an MRI.

How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer. One way of dealing with the risk is to think of it like a screening, at least I know there isn't anything sinister going around in my belly.
18. Unsual sweating 
So i have this unsual sweating from past few days.I start to sweat whenever i go outside only at chest and back .The areas which feel hot whenever i am inside my house even though I don't have fever when checked through thermometer.And also at night i feel this burning/coldish sensation at random areas of my body.What could it be?
19. Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a "too much" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily. 

Where I do I start to fix this...?
20. Side effects from taking my adderall in the morning and drinking alcohol in the afternoon around 3pm? ive been on vacation in the bahamas since march 31st til yesterday april 8th. Everyday we were super active always going out on the boat in the sun all day. On April 7th i took 20mg of adderall 3 times that day spread out between 2hrs each dose. So all together that day i had 60mg.and about an hour and a half later of my last dose i drank two rum punches throughout 3 hours time. After that about 2 and a half hours later i had 2 other rum punches again in a spand of 1 and a half hours. I never got drunk just felt pretty tipsy and good. I went to bed around 10:30pm feeling fine, not drunk at all. I woke up around 1230am with heavy vertigo and my stomach started hurting i went back to sleep hoping i would feel better in the morning. Well i woke up around 7am to get ready to leave for our flight and the vertigo was back and the stomach pain. I only puked twice i felt better after i got home in florida around 4pm i was 80% back to normal. I went to bed around 10pm last night and woke up today around 8am i feel like im in a daze like sleepy but i feel very out of it i feel depressed and have loads of anxiety (which i already have normally) i dont know whats wrong with me im freaking out, im scared this has permanently damaged my brain and in going to feel like this forever. Is it because im off vacation? Or because a counteractment with my adderall and alcohol? Someone please ease my mind i hate feeling this way. And any pointers on how to get myself back to normal :(
21. Hantavirus anxiety Hello folks. 

I am trying to ease some of my fear of hantavirus. I work in a place that does have a deer mice presence. Recently I went into a utility closet to grab a dolly. I noticed rodent droppings on the floor. I didn't mess with them at all but I did definitely breathe while I was in there. Does anyone have any understand of hantavirus on a deeper level? I know it is extremely rare and caused by kicking up dust that has been contaminated. But what are the odds that I get hantavirus assuming the mouse excrement in that closet was even infectious? 

I seem to be the only person at my work who has any real concern over it and it's driving me nuts.

Thanks so much for any insight.
22. restless and restless, want to be angry
23. Overthinking How can I control my thoughts instead of letting them overwhelm me ?
24. I need surgery, or some operation. I can't handle my anxiety anymore, what should I do? I've had anxiety for 6 years, I am 17. I've gone through therapy, a lot of medication. Zolof, prozac, and some depression medication. My parent's don't want me to move up in medication anymore. My therapist switched hours, so I had to leave counseling, which wasn't doing nothing anyway. And my mother pulled me off my medication. I just don't know what to do anymore, my anxiety is being my depression back. I literally can't function with it, I'm afraid to drive, hangout with friends, work, go placed alone, meet new people, and performing in bed. Just stupid shit, my head is constantly overflowing with thoughts I can't control. I try so hard, I'm aware when I'm having a panic attack, then it just leads to more thinking. I vomit when I have an anxiety attack. Just today, we had to play basketball in gym, and I went to the bathroom to fucking throw up, I don't even know what causes it. I just want to get surgery, I don't even care of it will fuck me up, I'm just at that point. I can't live life like this (No I'm not suicical). Please just give me some ideas of procedures I could do. And don't tell me to meditate, see a therapist, or stay on my meds longer. I've tried it all. I just need to know if there's any surgeries I can do. Thank you.
25. Twitching, anxiety, stress For the past 2 or 3 months (at least) I've been having muscle twitching all over my body. Feet, lower legs, thighs, quads, back, stomach, face (especially my right eye). 

I tried to do some guided relaxation the other night and found that over about 25 minutes of this relaxation I only had 2 or 3 twitches.

Still I worry that it's ALS or something.

On top of the twitching my legs feel sore and my muscles feel tight/fatigued. Taking to a friend I'm told that your body releases some hormones when you're stressed that can make muscles tighten.

I don't have any real weakness. I can still do pushups, run, etc.

I don't really know. Just looking for some support
26. Terooosss nervous huuuu
27. Aussie Flu So according to the news, Aussie flu is going round. Obviously my body decided to give me a cold, But my brain is convinced it's the Aussie flu thing, I know logically it's just a cold but my brain is constantly trying to convince me otherwise. My symptoms aren't nearly as bad as people describe. Just doing the classic seeking for reassurance, Thanks guys
28. injury and illness fantasies tldr: does anyone else have fantasies about getting sick or injured and others feeling sympathy for you and how do you move past them?

for as long as i can remember I've always had fantasies about getting injured or sick and having people feel sympathy for me and take care of me. as a little kid when i would play with my toys the stories i made up would always revolve around someone getting injured or sick and others taking care of them. I've always felt so embarrassed and ashamed of these fantasies and I've realized i probably bave these fantasies cause all I've ever wanted was someone to notice how much I'm struggling and actually comfort me and understand how hard everything is for me. but these fantasies just make me feel like a terrible person. I've never admitted this to anyone just cause of how awful it makes me feel when i think about the reality of my fantasies.
29. Heart feels like it's beating too hard Hello. I've been sick for the past week or so (I think it's the flu), and I'm on the tail end of it. Just earlier today I started having some discomfort in my chest and so I've been trying to avoid using those muscles too much. I just woke up ~10 minutes ago, and my heart was beating 80 times per minute, and way harder than normal. it's now 20 minutes since I woke up, and it's going back down closer to normal. This has happened to me only a few times in the past year, and I'm worried it might be something serious.
30. Help ma mental... It's really like this... .I just told myself this afternoon that you're great, great because of your anxiety and overthinking you haven't appeared in a few months, but why is it now showing up again ️
31. Am I Going Crazy? So, I’m a healthy 27 year old American woman (today is my birthday) and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I can’t seem to get a grip on anything. For reference, it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldn’t seem to go away. I’m currently living in Spain, which is where I’m currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted, lots of mucus coming out, constipation, tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January, the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark, and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldn’t see clearly, but my other organs looked good. But then, my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool, found something that looked like a worm, went to the emergency room, tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms (This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved).
Just after my first dose of mebendazole, I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldn’t breathe in all the way, but that was it. Anyway, in addition to that, I began to have sinus pressure, a mild sore throat, and drainage. 
I took my second dose of the worm medicine, had a stool sample that came back clear of everything (no blood), and even a chest X-ray that was clear. I’ve been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up, I’ve been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I haven’t been able to completely shake this cold yet and it’s been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse, I’m still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then, last night, I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly, I just feel like I’m shutting down and I haven’t felt healthy in a long time. I can’t seem to shake this chest cold, my digestive problems are still there, have some reflux too, and now pvcs. I feel like I’m a mess... just spent the morning of my 27th birthday in the emergency room getting the tests on my heart. Can anyone relate?
32. Seroquel makes depressed I have major depressive disorder and social anxiety  I take  400mg seroquel for sleep and have a weird side effect , when I take it makes me have those sudden life realisations about my self *really bad thoughts” 

Exactly like a bad weed trip and that’s why I stopped smoking weed .

It’s weird since I’ve tried all drugs from benzos and opium to ssris and snri and it’s the only drug that makes me feel this way 

Why I am feeling this way? I searched a lot and couldn’t find people with the same problem
33. If I had headaches that came on, but have now dissapeared, should I not be worried? Hi everyone,

I had headaches last weekend that lasted for a few days. They were pretty bad, around the forehead area and came on in the mornings and evenings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. They pretty much went away from like Monday to Thursday, except for a dull feeling, but now that is gone as well. So should I be worried of something such as a brain tumor? I was diagnosed with an ear infection but I am taking antibiotics. 

I haven't really had any other issues. I have been stressed about my short term memory, but I am able to recall stuff well but I sometimes forgot about tasks I need to do. I do have ADHD so I believe this is the cause, but I tend to remember the tasks. I also have some moments where I am zoning out because I am thinking so much, but this only happens when I am in front of a computer and I am usually able to recognize that I am not paying attention and snap out of it, so I dont believe I am having seizures.
34. Intrusive thoughts I feel like my intrusive thoughts are winning right now, and I feel bad for every thought. I feel like a terrible person and I need to remove myself from everyone because I'm a terrible person and no one would want me around. My inner voice is very mean and I just don't know anymore. I'm just so tired of it all.

Does anyone have their own tip/trick to dealing with their intrusive thoughts? 

Thank you in advance
35. Obsessive about heart rate + chewing tobacco At night my heart rate has been in the 60s, slowly trying to quit chewing tobacco but recently started worrying that my heart rate is too slow especially since I just put a dip in and that is supposed to elevate heartrate and blood pressure but my heart rate is still in the 60s to 70s range scared I'm always in heart failure... literally laying here thinking my heart is failing and scared to call 911 because of many false alarms in the past that lead me to call 911 about 4 times in 2 weeks only once taken to a hospital where they wanted me to stay inpatient but with agoraphobia and panic attacks I was too uncomfortable with the idea of being locked up away from home and no way of getting out before a 3 day stay... feeling depressed and hopeless and that I'm gonna mistake a real heart attack for a panic attack or just write it off as my body being calm from meds I take... idk just don't have anyone to talk to about this especially at night 9pm where I'm at...
36. Anxious about whether my dog bit the postman or not lol I'm scared my dog bit my postman when I'm not at home. My granny had dementia and by the looks of it opened the door for postman. Usually she slightly opens the door to not let the dog out but I'm scared she let him out.

My dog has never bit another person before and only barks at them. One time my uber came through the back and he only barked his head off him hut the uncertainty is killing me. As far as I know Australia doesn't kill dogs off first attempts but I'm still scared.
37. Bone tumor I had been doing so well for a couple years up until recently. I've got a bony lump growing on my sternum over the last two months, with pain being present for the past 1.5 months. I had an x-ray, blood test, and CT scan. The lump is undoubtably growing and the pain is still there. All the scans and the blood test came back fine, the radiologist just noted a "sternal notch" and everything else was fine, there were no suggestions as to what it is or anything. 

My university doctor doesn't seem to know what it is and just said "you may be producing extra cartilage right now. It might be one of these things where you'll have to wait up to 6-8 months for the pain to go away." How is the pain supposed to go away if this bony lump is still growing and likely won't disappear without surgery?

I feel better with the radiologist not being suspicious of the lump, but I still feel uncomfortable because no one knows what it is yet and I feel like bone cancer is still kind of in the picture. My sternum/sternal joint pain is still here and it has been 1.5 months. I'm making an appointment with my real doctor back home to try and nail this shit down. I'm 22, about to graduate, and I really don't need bone cancer to kill me right now.
38. Fear about having a neurological disease Hey everyone, the last 3-4 days my anxiety have been high and i started noticing some things on my body, spasms being what is trully worrying me
 I noticed i have a very small spasm on my arm muscle and on my leg muscle... sometimes the spasm is so soft that i cant really say if it is really spasms or just my pulsation but this have been driving me nuts today... Im just about to go to sleep and i noticed these spasms on my arm and on my leg happening all the time....they aren't violent they are soft and sometimes it feels like it is my blood pulsation....to make things worse i researched about neurological diseases and seen spasms related to ALS and multiple sclerosis and it has been driving crazy...i need to go to a neurologist but these things takes time and the results might be months from now and until there i will suffer this painful doubt about what my problem is...im really scared to be honest, i have developed a couple diseases recently due to the lifestyle of being severely depressed and i got a bunch of health problems...feels these things keep stacking up, health problem after health problem...i had a typical hypochondria episode many years ago that was typically delusional but i thought i overcame it....nowdays whenever my anxiety is high i start worrying about health problems that i already have...and symptoms that i wasn't able to find an answer yet...it is still there and it turns my peace of mind into hell..i dont know what to do about this...i am the kind of person that dont ease up until i get answers...i wont be able to rest until i know what i have and it is psychologically painful
39. Feeling as blue as the planet is warm TW CLIMATE CHANGE

I am 22 yo and I've been studying to become a lawyer for the past 6 years.

I'm on the verge of finishing my studies and I ask myself: what's the point?

How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal, as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?

I've been worried about the environment for years, especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.

In order not to be crushed with worry, I held onto the idea that, at worse, our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

I'm scared and I feel helpless, especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world. 

I feel like it's too late for lawyers to be helpful in urgent times, as law is such a slow process. I feel like what we need are people in the field; scientists, real politicians, essential jobs, etc.

I feel useless, and I feel really unmotivated to keep on working for my master's thesis.
40. Symptoms without any cause Hi everyone,

Do you think it would be possible for people to have symptoms for longer times (headaches, fatigue, muscle aches) without ANY cause?
41. Fast heart rate I was at a baseball game and felt my heart was racing a bit. I checked an my pulse was around 112. It’s almost 3 hours later and I’m still around 100. I’m normally around 80. Of course I’m freaking out thinking that I’m having a heart attack. No other symptoms to speak of other than just feeling incredibly anxious...which I know isn’t helping the heart rate. Any experience with racing heart and how to help it calm down?
42. Really worried about my kidneys. Any advice? I'm a 20 year old male, 5'7", 130lbs. I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ug/L and B12 high at 658 pmol/L and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmol/L. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umol/L and magnesium at 0.99 mmol/L. My urine came back negative for protein, blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ug/L.  I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what I've read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast? Thanks 

Also my grandma had polycystic kidney disease but from my understanding it was not the heredarity type.
43. what needs to be done today already, but still feeling restless
44. Rabies Anxiety I’ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently I’ve been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbor’s cat that had jumped over the fence. I didn’t want them to get in a fight so I shoo’d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that I’m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesn’t help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesn’t help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that I’ve been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive. 
I’m not sure exactly what to do about this or what this post is supposed to do. I’m on lexapro for general anxiety and OCD tendencies. I guess I just want to be told I’m a healthy idiot.
45. Do I have cancer? Fluid in my lungs? I’ve had the flu for about a week and my breathing is bubbly and feels more like wheezing, is there fluid in my lungs? And does that mean I have lung cancer?
46. Finally taking control of my Mental Health, rather than letting it control me. The string snapped, the tiredness, anxiety and depression became too much so I decided to press pause and take some time out to recharge. I have taken sick leave from my job that exacerbated my anxiety, I'm going to start on anxiety medication again, I'm in counselling and I'm going to look at starting CBT. 

Enough is enough. It's time to get my life to how I want it to be,I'm not being held hostage by my anxiety any longer.
47. Mood tracking apps I've got therapy starting up soon and I have bad mood swings but I forget them a lot too and I need to track them. 

Does anybody know good app that lets you put more then one mood in a day?
48. can’t sleep cause my whole body is numb i feel so uncomfortable idk if it’s numbness or dpdr but it’s scary, i upped my lexapro a week a go so it might be that but idk help
49. Should I be worried about hickeys? Hi I’m already anxious about some things but now I’m really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 2-3 inches down my neck. I read an article about two people who died from a blood clot that came from a hickey and I’m worried that because this one is so long that will happen to me too. They seem so innocent like just bruises but I’m freaking out. Does anyone know anything or should I be worried
50. I am 18 Just looking for people who suffered from anxiety, agoraphobia. it kind of feels like I just got spat out into the world. I left highschool partly due to mental health problems and wanting to move on to other things. I am not going back to high school and will probably do a TAFE course (I don’t need people telling me to go back to highschool) its different in my country (Australia). 

Just looking for people who suffered from anxiety, agoraphobia. it kind of feels like I just got spat out into the world, im being supported by my parents as of now and probably for a few more years but just so incredibly stressed because I am having a really hard time getting out of the house and dealing with my mental health (I have a therapist, do ACT therapy, meditate) just really worried that I am going to fuck things up and become addicted to drugs on the street, at least I will be out of the house 😭
